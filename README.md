**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This will be the template compiler used by Zotonic.

This compiler is a complete rewrite of the erlydtl fork used in Zotonic.

Main difference is that this compiler does not generate monolithic Erlang modules but smaller functional blocks.
These blocks can be re-used between different templates and sites.

Zotonic is the open source, high speed, real-time web framework  and content management system, built with Erlang. It is flexible, extensible and designed from the ground up to support dynamic, interactive websites and mobile solutions.
